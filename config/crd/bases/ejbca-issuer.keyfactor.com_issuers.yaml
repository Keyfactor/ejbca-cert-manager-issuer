              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                  The name of a ConfigMap containing the CA bundle to use when verifying
                  EJBCA's server certificate. If specified, the CA bundle will be added to

                  A reference to a Secret in the same namespace as the referent. If the
                  referent is a ClusterIssuer, the reference instead refers to the resource
                  with the given name in the configured 'cluster resource namespace', which
                  is set as a flag on the controller component (and defaults to the

                  Optional field that overrides the default for how the EJBCA issuer should determine the
                  name of the end entity to reference or create when signing certificates.
                  The options are:
                   * cn: Use the CommonName from the CertificateRequest's DN
                   * dns: Use the first DNSName from the CertificateRequest's DNSNames SANs
                   * uri: Use the first URI from the CertificateRequest's URI Sans
                   * ip: Use the first IPAddress from the CertificateRequest's IPAddresses SANs
                   * certificateName: Use the value of the CertificateRequest's certificateName annotation
                  If none of the above options are used but endEntityName is populated, the
                  value of endEntityName will be used as the end entity name. If endEntityName
                  is not populated, the default tree listed in the EJBCA documentation will be used.
