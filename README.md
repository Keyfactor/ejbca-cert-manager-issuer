The EJBCA external issuer for cert-manager allows users to enroll certificates from Keyfactor EJBCA using cert-manager.

Cert-manager is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller that allows applications to get their certificates from a variety of CAs (Certification Authorities). It ensures certificates are valid and up to date, it also attempts to renew certificates at a configured time before expiration.
